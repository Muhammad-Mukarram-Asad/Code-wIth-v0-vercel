**Problem:**  
I have a video in my public folder of an next.js app router project with a name ** "Hyku-Video-Animation" **. And I want to use it in my some component via Video tag. 
But instead of showing the video, the nextjs renders the 404 Not Found page in the browser. The default page for an improper route.  
So the actual root cause of the above problem is as follows:  
** Your App Router setup + not-found.tsx is taking precedence over static asset resolution in dev, and every unknown URL (including .mp4) is being rendered as a page.**
